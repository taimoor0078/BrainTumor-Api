# BRISC 2025 — Brain Tumor MRI Dataset

> **BRISC** (BRain tumor Image Segmentation & Classification) — a curated, expert-annotated T1 MRI dataset for multi-class brain tumor classification and pixel-wise segmentation.

[ArXiv preprint (Fateh et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14318)

---

##  Overview

BRISC is designed to address common shortcomings in existing public brain MRI collections (e.g., class imbalance, limited tumor types, and annotation inconsistency). It provides high-quality, physician-validated pixel-level masks and a balanced multi-class classification split, suitable for benchmarking segmentation and classification algorithms as well as multi-task learning research.

**Highlights**
- 6,000 T1-weighted MRI slices (5,000 train / 1,000 test)
- Four classes: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, **No Tumor**
- Pixel-wise segmentation masks reviewed by radiologists
- Slices from three anatomical planes: **Axial**, **Coronal**, **Sagittal**
- Clean, stratified train/test splits and aligned image–mask filenames

**Notes:**
- Classification folders contain image-level labels suitable for standard image classification pipelines.
- Segmentation folders contain paired MRI `images/` and corresponding binary `masks/`.
- Image and mask filenames are identical except for file extension (images: `.jpg`, masks: `.png`).
- All images are T1-weighted slices.

## File naming convention

Filenames follow a consistent pattern to make parsing straightforward:

```
brisc2025_<split>_<index>_<tumor>_<view>_<sequence>.<ext>
```

- `prefix` — `brisc2025`
- `split` — `train` or `test`
- `index` — zero-padded image number (e.g. `00010`)
- `tumor` — `gl` (glioma), `me` (meningioma), `pi` (pituitary), `nt` (no tumor)
- `view` — `ax` (axial), `co` (coronal), `sa` (sagittal)
- `sequence` — `t1` (T1-weighted)

**Example image filename:** `brisc2025_test_00010_gl_ax_t1.jpg`  
**Corresponding mask filename:** `brisc2025_test_00010_gl_ax_t1.png` (same basename, different extension)

## Dataset statistics

- **Total samples:** 6,000 (5,000 train / 1,000 test)
- **Classes:** 4 (balanced distribution across train/test)
- **Planes:** Axial / Coronal / Sagittal (balanced representation)
- **Imaging modality:** T1-weighted MRI
- **Annotation quality:** Reviewed and corrected by medical experts
